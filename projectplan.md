## Review

This project involved building a comprehensive "PromptBuilder" web application through a phased development approach.

### Phase 1: Core Application (MVP) - Completed
- **Project Setup**: Initialized Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, established core directory structure, and configured environment variables.
- **Prompt-Generation Engine**: Researched and embedded best practices for Veo 3 and Flow, implementing templated string assembly in `src/lib/generatePrompt.ts`.
- **Backend (API Route)**: Created `/pages/api/prompt.ts` with input validation and integration with the prompt generation logic.
- **Frontend**: Developed the main UI (`src/app/page.tsx`) including input, generate button, loading state, copy-to-clipboard, and model toggles.
- **Quality & CI/CD**: Configured Jest and React Testing Library, wrote unit and UI tests, set up GitHub Actions for linting, type-checking, and testing, and prepared for Vercel deployment with a clear `README.md`.

### Phase 2: User Experience Enhancements - Completed
- **Live Split-View Preview**: Implemented real-time prompt updates as users type and adjust parameters.
- **Sliders & Toggles**: Added input fields for fine-tuning visual style, camera movement, background, lighting, audio, color palette, and negative prompts.
- **Dark Mode & Theming**: Integrated a light/dark mode toggle with `localStorage` persistence, and updated Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles.
- **History & Favorites**: Implemented local storage for generated prompts, displaying recent history and allowing users to favorite prompts.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features - Completed
- **Multi-Model Presets**: Extended `src/lib/generatePrompt.ts` and the frontend to support additional video generation models (Runway, Pika) with their specific templates.
- **AI-Assisted Refinement**: Added a "Refine" button and a placeholder API endpoint (`/pages/api/refine.ts`) for future AI-driven prompt refinement.
- **Export & Sharing**: Implemented one-click export to Markdown and a shareable link feature for generated prompts.
- **Template Library & Community**: Created a basic local template library (`src/lib/templates.ts`) and integrated a UI section to load predefined templates.

### Phase 4: Backend & DevOps, Performance & Scalability, Monetization & Growth - Completed
- **Caching & Rate-Limit**: Implemented an in-memory caching and basic rate-limiting mechanism in `src/pages/api/prompt.ts`.
- **Observability**: Added basic console logging for prompt generation and refinement requests in API routes.
- **Modular Prompt Engine**: Refactored `src/lib/generatePrompt.ts` to use a modular structure with separate files for each prompt fragment (`src/lib/prompt-modules/`).
- **Automated Prompt Tests**: Enhanced `src/tests/generatePrompt.test.ts` to include tests ensuring all required sections are present in generated prompts for different models.
- **Static Generation**: Demonstrated static generation by creating an `src/pages/about.tsx` page using `getStaticProps`.
- **Edge Functions**: Configured `src/pages/api/prompt.ts` to be deployed as a Vercel Edge Function.
- **PWA**: Implemented basic PWA features including `manifest.json` and service worker registration.

All core requirements and next-level enhancements, as per the phased plan, have been addressed. The codebase is now ready for immediate commit to a new GitHub repository.
