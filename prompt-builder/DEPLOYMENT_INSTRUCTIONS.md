# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Configure GitHub Pages Source

The GitHub Actions workflow has been created, but GitHub Pages needs to be configured to use it. Follow these steps:

### 1. Configure GitHub Pages Source

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Eli45-23/prompt
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Save the changes

### 2. Verify Repository Secret

Ensure the OpenAI API key is properly configured:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` exists in Repository secrets
3. The secret name must match exactly (case-sensitive)

### 3. Monitor Deployment

After configuring the source:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Watch for new workflow runs
3. Check the "Debug environment variables" step to see if the API key is detected
4. If successful, the site will be available at: https://eli45-23.github.io/prompt

### 4. Troubleshooting

If Magic Mode still doesn't work after deployment:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the workflow logs show: "✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY is configured"
3. Ensure the secret value starts with "sk-" and is a valid OpenAI API key

### 5. Current Status

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created with debugging
- ✅ Manifest.json path fixed for GitHub Pages
- ✅ PWA icon errors resolved
- ⚠️ **PENDING**: GitHub Pages source configuration (manual step required)
- ⚠️ **PENDING**: Verify API key is properly injected during build

## Expected Result

Once GitHub Pages is configured to use GitHub Actions:
- Magic Mode will work properly with OpenAI integration
- No more manifest.json 404 errors
- Environment variables will be properly embedded in the static build
