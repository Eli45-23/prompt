## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptbuilder.git
   cd promptbuilder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```
   PROMPT_ENGINE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key for calling a prompt-engine service.

### Running the Development Server

## How to Update Prompt Templates

The prompt templates are located in `src/lib/generatePrompt.ts`. You can modify the `veo3Template` and `flowTemplate` strings to update the prompt generation logic. The templates are designed to be easily extensible. When new features or best practices are introduced, you can add new sections to the templates.

For example, if a new parameter for controlling the "emotional tone" is added, you could add a new line to the templates like:

```
Emotional Tone: {emotional_tone}
```

Then, you would need to update the `promptFragments` object and the `generatePrompt` function to handle the new parameter.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
# or yarn test
```
